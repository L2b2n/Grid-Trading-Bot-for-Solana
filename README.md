Set the swap amount per grid layer (e.g., 0.003 SOL) to manage your investment size.



Configure slippage tolerance (e.g., 0.2%) to protect against unfavorable price movements.



Define refresh intervals (e.g., 5 seconds) for real-time price updates.



Stop-Loss Protection: Automatically stops trading if your portfolio value drops below a user-defined threshold (e.g., -20%) to minimize losses.



Solana & Jupiter Integration: Leverages the Jupiter API for fast and reliable price data and swap execution on Solana, one of the fastest blockchains.



Detailed Logging: Tracks all trades, balances, and profits with comprehensive logs (gridbot.log) for transparency and debugging.



User-Friendly Setup: Easy to configure and run using tmux on a Linux server (e.g., Ubuntu), with step-by-step instructions provided.
